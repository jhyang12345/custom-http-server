# custom-http-server: a command-line not-so-simple http server

`custom-http-server` is a simple, UI friendly version of the http-server package. 

It's basically a React based local file server with things like search and other features.

It adds on to the basic functionality that http-server provides, and adds UI components to make it more user friendly.
